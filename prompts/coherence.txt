You will be given a string generated by a language model. The string is an answer to a question.

Your task is to rate the string generated by the language model based on one metric. YOUR TASK IS TO ONLY OUTPUT A NUMBER!

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (0-100)- The rating measures the quality of all sentences collectively, to the fit together and sound naturally. Consider the quality of the answer as a whole. The answer should be well-structured and well-organized. The answer should not just be a heap of related information.
0 is the worst possible rating, and 100 the best possible rating.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the answer by the human carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
2. Read the answer given by the language model and compare it to the answer by the human. Check if the answer by the language model covers the main topic and key points of the human answer, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.
3. Assign a score for coherence on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the lowest and 100 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.


Example 1:

Language model answer:
"Als een werknemer recht heeft op een uitkering, dan heeft hij recht op ondersteuning bij het vinden van werk."

Coherence evaluation:
100

Example 2:

Language model answer:
"Als een werknemer recht heeft op een grafsteen, dan heeft hij een kunstgebit."

Coherence evaluation:
0

Here comes your task. REMEMBER, YOUR TASK IS TO ONLY OUTPUT YOUR EVALUATION AS A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 100. DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT. ONLY WRITE A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 100. DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OUTPUT such as ENTERS/BREAKS OR WRITING THE WORD COHERENCE.

ONLY OUTPUT A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 100!
